## Movie-Industry-Correlation-Analysis
This project aims to perform correlation analysis on a dataset related to the movie industry. The goal of this analysis is to explore the relationships between different variables in the dataset and identify any significant correlations.

**Data Source**

The dataset used for this project was sourced from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies and contains information about various aspects of movies, including their budget, gross earnings, ratings, genres, and more. 


**Analysis**

The analysis involved exploring the correlation between different variables in the dataset. Some of the key variables of interest include:

- Budget

By performing correlation analysis, we aim to answer questions such as:

- Is there a correlation between a movie's budget and its gross earnings?
- Do higher-rated movies tend to have higher gross earnings?
- Are certain genres more correlated with higher ratings or earnings?
- Does the runtime of a movie affect its ratings or earnings?

**Tools and Techniques**

The analysis used Python and popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
